### SUM Function:

• The SUM function is used to add up a range of numbers.

• Example: If you have numbers in cells A1 to A5 (say, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50), you can use =SUM(A1:A5) to get the total, which would be 150.

### MIN Function:

• The MIN function returns the smallest number in a range.

• Example: Using the same numbers as above, =MIN(A1:A5) would give you 10, which is the smallest number in the range.

### MAX Function:

• The MAX function returns the largest number in a range.

• Example: With the numbers 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 in cells A1 to A5, =MAX(A1:A5) would.

### AVERAGE Function: 

• The AVERAGE function calculates the average (mean) of a range of numbers.

• Example: Continuing with the numbers above, =AVERAGE(A1:A5) would give you the average, which is 30 (since (10+20+30+40+50)/5 = 30).

### COUNT Function:

• The COUNT function counts the number of cells that contain numbers within a specified range.

• Example: If you have numbers and blank cells in cells A1 to A5, COUNT(A1:A5) would count how many cells contain numbers.
